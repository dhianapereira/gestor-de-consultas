# Health Unit

Web app for a fictional health unit for better management of the patient's medical record and initial dengue diagnosis questionnaire.

## How to execute?

First you need to start Apache or if you are using Xampp, start Xampp. In phpMyAdmin you run the sql script, which is in `src/data/database`, to create the database. Finally, just put in the browser the url `http://localhost/health_unit/public/`.
